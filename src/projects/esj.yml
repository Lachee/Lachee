  Electronic Super Joy is a brutally hard platformer set in a world of pulse-pounding electronic music.
  Run, jump, smash & fly your way through 45+ weird & different levels, with low-gravity, world rotation, giant monsters & swarming missiles.


  I was tasked with creating a Nintendo Switch port of this game. 
  I had to integrate the Nintendo SDKs and rewrite the backend of the game to allow to for saving and loading onto the console. 
  The leaderboard feature also had to be recreated, using Nintendo's supplied Ranking API to send and retrieve leaderboard and ranking information.

  * Created online leaderboards with Nintendo's API

  * Implemented new saving mechanisms to work with the Switch

  * Converted Unity 4 project to Unity 2018
    * Fixed graphical and mesh issues that occured
    * Converted old deprecated methods to modern equivs
