  Electronic Super Joy (ESJ) is a brutally hard platformer set in a world of   pulse-pounding electronic music. Run, jump, smash & fly your way through 45+ weird & different levels, with low-gravity, world rotation, giant monsters & swarming missiles.

  I was tasked with creating a Nintendo Switch port of this game. I had to integrate the Nintendo SDKs and rewrite the backend of the game to allow to for saving and loading onto the console. The leaderboard feature also had to be recreated, using Nintendo's supplied Ranking API to send and retrieve leaderboard and ranking information.

  During the port, it was also necessary to upgrade the project from Unity 4 to the latest Unity 2019. This involved patching a lot of legacy code from the very early days of unity and bring it to the modern engine. A lot of the UI elements were actually offset because of some change between one of the patches, causing all the legacy 3D text being shifted down lower than expected.
