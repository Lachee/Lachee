name: Discord RPC CSharp

description: |
  This is a C# implementation of the Discord RPC library which was originally written in C
  This avoids having to use the official C++ and instead provides a managed way of using the Rich Presence within the .NET environment*.


  My most popular project on my GitHub, a implementation of Discord's RPC protocol from the grounds up to better support Unity3D.
  I had to implement a custom solution because of Unity's limitations and trying to avoid native libraries.

  
  Unfortantly, i was unable to avoid native libraries completely, and had to resort in a fully custom `NamedPipeStream` for Unity3D,
  as a bug in Mono causes Unity3D to hard freeze when using a pipe as duplex.
