  Visualise your discord bots with a fully featured node based editor. 
  XVE is my side project to create a visual editor for Discord bots, and bots in general. 


  Currently being refactored, XVE aims to be a plugin solution for hosting providers to allow visual editing of bots.
  There plans to be extendable and fully modular for future uses such as Twitch Bots.


  I wrote the entire project from the grounds up. Implementing the API and renders, creating a custom framework to support it.
