  Party Crashers is a last-car-standing combat racer for one to four players! It
  aims to provide the same fast-paced competitive couch-play as games like Micro
  Machines, Mashed, and Wrecked, and also follows in the footsteps of Party
  Golf, with crazy customisation options for everything our player.


  I was the lead programmer in Party Crashers and was put in charge of many of
  the core systems such as the pickups track effects and platform integration. I
  added support for all platforms (Steam, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch) which
  involved creating wrappers and implementing different APIs provided by the
  platforms and handling a variety of controller configurations.
