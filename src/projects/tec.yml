  The Eternal Castle [REMASTERED] is a retro indie game taking inserpation from titles such as Prince of Persia. 
  Navigate through a story driven platformer with retro "CGA Graphics".


  I ported this game from an existing Game Maker Studio 2 project for the PlayStation 4. Having never used GMS2 before,
  it was a learning curve and a challange I manage to hit and complete. 


  I had to rewrite much of the saving and menu logic to work with the PS4 (while keeping everything backwards compatible for other consoles),
  and deal with long strange loading times that were only specific for the PS4. Such example, after long hours, I discovered screen view shifting below 0 caused
  the PlayStation to completely black screen and not render anything.

  * Rewrote save to support async

  * Implemented custom loading screen for PS4
    * PS4 loaded much slower and to get around QA it needed modifications to not freeze.

  * Implemented custom extensions to support some features such as controller colours

  * Provided support for patches and future bug fixes

  * Deep-Delved into AI to improve performance for the PS4
