  Electronic Super Joy 2 is the successor to Electronic Super Joy 1, with the space fast pace platforming.
  Players find themselves running and jumping through an obstacle course with pulse-pounding electronic music.


  I was in charge of porting this game to both the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4. I implemented the saving mechanisms for 
  both consoles, and implemented leader boards. While DLC was not used in the final release, I had to implement it and the tooling to generate
  DLC packages for both Nintendo and PS4. 

  * Created online leaderboards with Nintendo's API

  * Created online leaderboards with Sony's API

  * Implemented new saving mechanisms to work with the consoles

  * Created editor extensions to easily create DLC packages that can be submitted to Sony or Nintendo
