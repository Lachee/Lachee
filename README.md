**Hacktober Notice**

I will _not_ be accepting "spelling and grammar" changes for any of my repositories during this month. 
Its my opinion that Hacktober is here to encourage useful collaboration and contribution too projects. While spelling corrections are useful, I feel that they are not in the spirit of hacktoberfest and are done "just to get free stuff".
